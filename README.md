jsmeter-web
===========

A simple web based UI for jsmeter.  Also includes a command line version of the tool.  This is similar to the jsmeter.info but designed to run locally using nodejs.

This uses express to make url mappings easier.  The default port is 12000, so if you want to change that it is currently a code change.
